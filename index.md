I enjoy web app pentesting, CTFs, and learning about current cybersecurity news. 
Here I'll blog completed labs, CTFs, boxes, or any projects that peak my interests in the field of cybersecurity or programming.

I'm interested in Cyber Security because there's never a shortage of knowledge to learn. There is a broad spectrum of concepts, tools, technologies, and responsibilities that one needs to know before being well versed in it. I've recently been learning general Information Technologies as the fundamentals are vital for a strong foundation in Cyber Security. 

Programming, Technical Writing, Systems Management, Cloud Security, Offensive Security, Cyber Security Infrastructures, and Risk Management are all areas that I would like to learn more of.
